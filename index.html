<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Kristen Jaymes Stewart (born April 9, 1990) is an American actress and filmmaker. The world's highest-paid actress in 2012, her accolades include a BAFTA Award, a César Award (making her the only American actress to receive the award), and a nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

    Born and raised in Los Angeles to parents who both worked in the entertainment industry, Stewart first gained notice at age 12 for her role as the daughter of Jodie Foster's character in David Fincher's thriller Panic Room (2002), which earned her a Young Artist Award nomination. She subsequently starred in Speak (2004), Catch That Kid (2004), Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), and Into the Wild (2007). She then rose to stardom for her lead role as Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga film series (2008–2012), which collectively grossed over $3.3 billion worldwide; for the role, she was awarded the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2010.
    
    After starring in the fantasy film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Stewart eschewed roles in big-budget films in favor of independent productions in the years following. She took on roles in the dramas Camp X-Ray and Still Alice (both 2014), and the science fiction romance Equals (2016). In 2015, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance in Olivier Assayas' drama film Clouds of Sils Maria, which won her the César Award for Best Supporting Actress. Stewart reunited with Assayas the following year in the supernatural thriller Personal Shopper (2016) and made her directorial debut with the short film Come Swim (2017). She returned to mainstream Hollywood with leading roles in the action film Charlie's Angels (2019) and the romantic comedy film Happiest Season (2020). Stewart went on to portray Diana, Princess of Wales in Pablo Larraín’s biographical and psychological drama Spencer (2021), for which performance received critical acclaim.</p>

<h2><strong>Personal life</strong></h2>

<p>Knows how to play the guitar.

    <p>In 2004-2009 she met the actor Michael Angarano, whom she met on the set of the film "Speak".</p>
    
    <p> While filming Twilight in 2008, she met actor Robert Pattinson. The first discord happened in the summer of 2012 after Kristen Stewart's romance with the director of the film "Snow White and the Huntsman" Rupert Sanders. Pattinson sold the house in which he was going to live with Stewart, and the actress herself went to her mother. But in September 2012, the couple reconciled, and Stewart received a marriage proposal. However, after a while they finally parted.</p>

    
    She is bisexual. In 2017, on Saturday Night Live, the actress described herself as "very homosexual." In the summer of 2016, in an interview, she confirmed that she had been dating special effects designer Alisha Kargile for a long time. For some time, there were rumors in the press about the couple's wedding, but soon the girls broke up. In addition to Cargyle Stewart, she dated French singer and actress Soko, and she also had a short affair with singer and producer Saint Vincent, who was working on the soundtrack for Stewart's directorial debut. From December 2016 to December 2018, she was in a relationship with model Stella Maxwell. The couple reunited briefly in 2019, but Stewart soon struck up a relationship with screenwriter Dylan Mayer.</p>
